## ðŸ—‚ MongoDB Data Model

MongoDB organizes data as:

- **Database** â†’ container for collections
- **Collection** â†’ group of documents (like a SQL table)
- **Document** â†’ individual data record (JSON-like object)

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```json
{
  "_id": "64a7f0c5f93d3b001f7c1a12",
  "name": "Ehtesham",
  "email": "ehtesham@example.com",
  "age": 21
}
```
